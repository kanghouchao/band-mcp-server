## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Band API access token (obtainable from [Band Developer Portal](https://developers.band.us/develop/myapps/list))
- VS Code with MCP support or any MCP-compatible client
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### VS Code Integration

Add the following configuration to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "band_access_token",
        "description": "BAND Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "band-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-e", "BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN", "kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest"],
        "env": {
          "BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:band_access_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd band-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
make install
# or
npm install

# Set up environment variables
echo "BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here" > .env

# Run in development mode
make dev
# or
npm run dev

# Build the project
make build
# or
npm run build

# Run tests
make test
# or
npm test
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
make docker-build
# or
docker build -t band-mcp-server:latest .

# Run Docker container
make docker-run
# or
docker run --rm -i -e BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here band-mcp-server:latest
```

## Available MCP Tools

## Alternative MCP startup methods

This project now supports multiple ways to start the MCP server. Choose the option that best fits your environment.

- Docker (recommended for isolation and production):

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest .
docker run --rm -i -e BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest
```

- Global npm install (convenient for CLI-style usage):

```bash
npm install -g .
# Then run
band-mcp-server
```

- Run directly from the public registry (no install):

```bash
# Run the published package once via npx
npx band-mcp-server
```

- Install from the public registry (local install):

```bash
# Install as a dependency in the current project
npm i band-mcp-server
# or install globally
npm i -g band-mcp-server
```

- Run the local repository (development):

```bash
# Run the package in the current checkout (no publish needed)
npx .
# or run the compiled/ts entry directly in dev with tsx
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

- Direct node/tsx (development):

```bash
# Run directly with tsx (fast dev experience)
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

When configuring MCP clients (e.g., VS Code settings), update the `command` and `args` fields to match the chosen startup method.

## About the "npx" / published-package startup

This project provides a small executable wrapper so the package can be run directly from the public npm registry using `npx` (for example: `npx band-mcp-server`). The wrapper is declared in the package `bin` field and forwards execution to the compiled CLI at `dist/cli.js`.

Key points and requirements:

- How it works: when you run `npx band-mcp-server`, npm will download the published package tarball, extract it to a temporary location, and run the executable declared in the package `bin` field (our `bin/band-mcp-server`). That wrapper loads `dist/cli.js` (ESM) which boots the MCP server.

- Build / publish considerations: the published package must include the compiled `dist/` output (or alternatively include a `prepare`/`postinstall` script to build at install time). Our `package.json` already contains a `prepublishOnly` script that runs the build and tests before publishing; ensure your release process publishes the built artifacts so `npx` users get a working binary.

- Environment variables: `npx` does not set environment variables for you. Provide required environment variables (for example `BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN`) in the same shell invocation:

```bash
# set the required token in the environment and run the published package once
BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here npx band-mcp-server
```

- Running a specific version: you can target a release tag or version with npx:

```bash
npx band-mcp-server@1.0.4
```

- Local development vs published package: during dev you can run `npx .` from the checkout (it will run the local `bin` wrapper or via tsx), but the published `npx <pkg>` behavior depends on what was included in the published tarball.

- Troubleshooting:
  - If `npx` fails with a missing module or cannot find `dist/cli.js`, verify the published package contains `dist/` or add a `prepare` script that builds on install.
  - If the CLI exits with permission errors, ensure the wrapper file has the executable permission in the published package (npm preserves file mode when packaging). Locally, ensure `bin/band-mcp-server` is executable (`chmod +x bin/band-mcp-server`).
  - For reproducible installs in CI or servers, prefer installing a specific version (`npm i band-mcp-server@1.0.4`) or pin the Docker image.

If you'd like, I can also add a short note to the `package.json` (a `files` entry or `prepare` script) to make publishing and `npx` more robust ‚Äî tell me which approach you prefer and I will prepare the change.

});
```

## Error Handling & API Limits

The server implements comprehensive error handling and respects Band API rate limits:

- **Authentication errors**: Clear error messages for invalid or expired tokens
- **Permission errors**: Detailed feedback when operations require higher permissions
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic handling of API rate limits with appropriate delays
- **Validation**: Input validation for all parameters using Zod schemas
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your Band API access token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the token has the necessary permissions for the operations you're trying to perform
- Check that the token is correctly set in the environment variable `BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### "Permission denied" errors
- Some operations require specific roles within a Band (leader, co-leader, etc.)
- Use the `permissions` tool to check your access rights for a specific Band
- Contact the Band administrator to request appropriate permissions

#### Docker container issues
- Ensure Docker is running and you have sufficient permissions
- Check that the environment variable is properly passed to the container
- Verify the Docker image is up to date: `docker pull kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest`

#### MCP client connection issues
- Verify your MCP client supports the required protocol version
- Check that the server command and arguments are correctly configured
- Review VS Code or client logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, set the environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=band-mcp-server:*
```
